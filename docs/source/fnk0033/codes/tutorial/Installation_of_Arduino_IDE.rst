Arduino Software
*******************************************************************************

Arduino Software (IDE) is used to write and upload the code for Arduino Board.

First, install Arduino Software (IDE): visit https://www.arduino.cc, click "Download" to enter the download page.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE00.png
    :align: center

Select and download corresponding installer based on your operating system. If you are a Windows user, please select the "Windows Installer" to download and install the driver correctly.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE01.png
    :align: center

After the download completes, run the installer. For Windows users, there may pop up an installation dialog during the installation. When it popes up, please allow the installation.

After installation is completed, an Arduino Software shortcut will be generated on the desktop. Run the Arduino Software.

The interface of Arduino Software is as follows:

Programs written with Arduino Software (IDE) are called sketches. These sketches are written in the text editor and saved with the file extension.ino. The editor has features for cutting/pasting and searching/replacing text. The message area gives feedback while saving and exporting and also displays errors. The console displays text output by the Arduino Software (IDE), including complete error messages and other information. The bottom right-hand corner of the window displays the configured board and serial port. The toolbar buttons allow you to verify and upload programs, create, open, and save sketches, and open the serial monitor.

Additional commands are found within the five menus: File, Edit, Sketch, Tools, Help. The menus are context sensitive, which means only those items relevant to the work currently being carried out are available.

Environment Configuration
**********************************************************************************

First, open the software platform arduino, and then click File in Menus and select Preferences.

Additional Remarks
**********************************************************************************

To finish this tutorial, you can use a Raspberry Pi Pico W or a Raspberry Pi Pico. The two boards have the same form factor, and their only difference is that Pico W features with an onboard single-band 4.802GHz wireless interface using Infineon CYW2. That is to say, the hardware Raspberry Pi Pico W is almost the same as the normal pico except for the wireless interface.

No matter which board you use, the procedure for each project is the same. You only need to select the correct board and upload the corresponding code based on the board you use. 

In this book, we use Raspberry Pi Pico W to illustrate the operation.

The followings show the configuration on Arduino for the use of each board.

For Raspberry Pi Pico:

Click Tools on Menu bar, click Board, select “Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040”, and select Raspberry Pi Pico. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE12.png
    :align: center

For Raspberry Pi Pico W:

Click Tools on Menu bar, click Board, select “Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040”, and select Raspberry Pi Pico W.

Uploading Adruino-compatible Firmware for Raspberry Pi Pico (W) 

To program a new Raspberry Pi Pico (W) with Arduino, you need to upload an Adruino-compatible Firmware for it. Please refer to the following steps to cinfigure.

1. Disconnect Pico (W) from your computer. Press and hold the white button (BOOTSEL) on Pico (W) while connecting it to your computer. (Note: Be sure to hold the button before powering the Pico, otherwise the firmware will not download successfully.)

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE14.png
    :align: center

2. Open Arduino IDE. Click File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE15.png
    :align: center

3. Click Tools > Board > Raspberry Pi RP2040 Boards > Raspberry Pi Pico W. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE16.png
    :align: center

4. Click Tools > Port > UF2 Board. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE17.png
    :align: center

5. Upload sketch to Raspberry Pi Pico W.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE18.png
    :align: center

When the sketch finishes uploading, you can see messages as below.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE19.png
    :align: center

The indicator on Pico W starts to flash.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE20.png
    :align: center

6. Click Tools>Port>COMx (Raspberry Pi Pico W). X of COMx varies from different computers. Please select the correct one on your computer. In our case, it is COM26. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Installation_of_Arduino_IDE/Arduino_IDE21.png
    :align: center

.. note::

    :red:`1. At the first use of Arduino to upload sketch for Pico (W), you need to select a port on the UF2 board. After that, each time before uploading sketch, please check whether the port has beed selected; otherwise, the downloading may fail.`
    
    :red:`2. Sometimes when used, Pico (W) may lose firmware due to the code and fail to work. At this point, you can upload firmware for Pico (W) as mentioned above.`

To facilitate your learning, the pins of Pico W and Pico are shown below:
